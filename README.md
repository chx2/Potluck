# Potluck

Do you ever get asked temporarily unsovlved questions like:

* What do you want for dinner?
* What do you want to do tonight?
* Who goes first this game?
* ~~Do you come up with any original ideas?~~

If so, Potluck is the answer! Just throw in some deciding factors and have total reliance on pseudo-randomness to make the tough decisions in life!
